📦 Multi-Warehouse Data Integration & Analysis
A project that integrates data from multiple warehouses, applies ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes using Python scripts, and visualizes insights through React, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.

🛠️ Tech Stack
ETL Processing: Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy)
Database: SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
API Layer: FastAPI/Flask
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js/D3.js
📌 Features
✅ Data Extraction: Retrieve inventory and sales data from multiple warehouse databases
✅ Data Transformation: Clean, normalize, and integrate data into a global schema
✅ Data Loading: Store processed data in an optimized SQL database
✅ API Development: Serve the transformed data via FastAPI/Flask
✅ Interactive Visualizations: Use React + Tailwind CSS for UI and Chart.js/D3.js for analytics
✅ Real-time Monitoring: Track inventory levels, sales trends, and warehouse efficiency

🗄️ Database Schema (Global Schema)
A global schema is designed to standardize and integrate data from multiple warehouses. It includes:

Warehouses Table: Stores warehouse metadata
Inventory Table: Tracks stock levels across warehouses
Sales Table: Logs product sales and timestamps
Each table is linked using foreign keys to maintain relational integrity.

📥 ETL Pipeline Overview
The ETL process ensures data is clean, structured, and ready for analysis.

1️⃣ Extract
Fetch data from multiple SQL databases (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
Connect using SQLAlchemy
Retrieve warehouse inventory and sales data
2️⃣ Transform
Remove duplicates, format timestamps, and normalize product names
Convert categorical fields into standardized formats
Aggregate data for analysis
3️⃣ Load
Store transformed data into a centralized SQL database
Automate periodic updates to keep data fresh
🌐 API Endpoint
A REST API is built using FastAPI/Flask
The API exposes endpoints for:
Fetching inventory levels per warehouse
Viewing sales trends
Retrieving real-time analytics
📊 Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)
Data Fetching: Calls the API to retrieve processed warehouse data
UI Design: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive layout
Graphs & Analytics: Uses Chart.js/D3.js for interactive data visualizations
Dashboard Components: Displays inventory trends, sales statistics, and warehouse efficiency
🚀 Running the Project
1️⃣ Set Up the Database
Install and configure MySQL/PostgreSQL
